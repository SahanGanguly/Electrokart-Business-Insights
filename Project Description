ElectroKart Business Insights Project
This project focuses on extracting valuable business insights from the ElectroKart sales database. By analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, I have solved key business problems to help improve customer retention, increase sales, and identify new opportunities.

Business Problems Solved
The following key business questions were answered through a series of SQL queries:

1. Customer Retention & Churn Analysis
Customer Retention Rate: I calculated the percentage of customers who made repeat purchases. This metric is crucial for understanding customer loyalty.

Region vs. Churn: I analyzed if the customer churn rate is higher in specific regions. This helps pinpoint geographical areas that may require targeted marketing or customer service efforts.

High-Value Lost Customers: I identified customers who have churned but had a total spending of over â‚¹50,000. These are critical customers to re-engage.

First-Time Buyer Conversion: I determined how many new customers successfully made a second purchase, becoming returning customers.

2. Sales & Product Performance
Top 5 Products by Revenue: I identified the top five best-performing products based on total revenue, considering discounts.

Monthly Sales Trend: I tracked the total sales per month in 2024 to identify any seasonal or monthly sales patterns.

Category-Wise Profit: I calculated the total profit for each product category to understand which categories are most profitable.

3. Strategic Opportunities
Churn Prediction Signals: I identified customers at risk of churning based on two key factors:

High returns: Customers who return more than 30% of their purchases.

Inactivity: Customers who haven't made a purchase in over 90 days.

Seasonality Analysis: I determined which month sees the highest revenue for each product category, which can inform inventory and marketing strategies.

Cross-Sell Opportunity: I identified which other product categories are most likely to be purchased by customers who buy a specific category. This helps in creating targeted product bundles and recommendations.
